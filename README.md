# CSI3450_Database_Design_Project
A relational database in MySQL with a front end web-app

In order to run the website, you need to have a few programs installed.
First you need to have node and npm installed. The packages from npm that you need for the node modules are mysql, express, and php-express which can be installed locally to the project folder by running the following commands in a terminal in the project directory:

npm i mysql

npm i express

npm i express-php

These commands add the necessary files in the node modules folder.

While the site uses bootstrap for the sites front end UI, it uses a CDN to retrieve the files and also the dependencies for bootstrap as well (jquery, popper.js).
